# Welcome to the Project!

Hello, I'm **Nishan** and welcome to this project! Let's get started with setting up and customizing the app.

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

After cloning the repository, follow these steps to set up and run the app.

### 1.1 Install Dependencies

First, navigate to the app directory:

```bash
cd app
```

Then, install the dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

### 1.2 Start the App

Once the dependencies are installed, you can power up the app using the following command:

```bash
npx expo start
```

This will start the Expo development server, and you'll be able to view the app on your device or emulator.

## What You Get

In this template, you'll find a **pre-configured layout** that includes the following:

1. **Landing Page**: The first screen that appears when the app starts.
2. **Main App Screen**: The second screen, which serves as the home page.
3. **Bottom Navigation Bar**: A navigation bar at the bottom of the home page, allowing easy navigation between different screens.

## Customizing the App

### 2.1 Customizing the Landing Page

To customize the **Landing Page**, navigate to the `landingpage.tsx` file in the **app directory**.

#### Steps to customize the landing page:

1. Open `landingpage.tsx`.
2. Modify the existing code to match your preferred design and content.
3. Save the file, and your changes will automatically be reflected when you reload the app.

### 2.2 Customizing the Bottom Navigation Bar

The **Bottom Navigation Bar** is part of the main app screen. To customize the navigation bar, you can add, remove, or reorder items.

#### Steps to customize the bottom navbar:

1. In the **app directory**, navigate to the `(tab)` folder. 
2. For each new tab item, create a new file inside the `(tab)` folder. Ensure the filename is descriptive of the tabâ€™s content.
   
   For example:
   - Create a new file `newTabScreen.tsx` for the new tab item.

3. Open the **_layout.tsx** file inside the `(tab)` folder, which is responsible for defining the tabs.

4. Add a new item to the navigation bar by inserting the following code:

   ```tsx
   <Tabs.Screen 
     name="newTabScreen.tsx" 
     options={{ title: "Custom Tab Title" }} 
   />
   ```

   - **name**: The name of the tab screen (corresponding to the file name).
   - **title**: The label that will appear on the tab.

5. You can reorder the items simply by changing their order in the `_layout.tsx` file.

## Example

Let's say you created a new tab called `profileTab.tsx` in the `(tab)` folder. To add it to the bottom navigation bar, you would:

1. Create `profileTab.tsx` in the `(tab)` folder.
2. Open `_layout.tsx` inside the same folder.
3. Add the following code to include it in the bottom nav:

   ```tsx
   <Tabs.Screen 
     name="profileTab.tsx" 
     options={{ title: "Profile" }} 
   />
   ```

### 2.3 Removing a Tab

To remove a tab, simply delete or comment out the corresponding `<Tabs.Screen />` entry from the `_layout.tsx` file.
